Text-classification-using-Neural-Network-Tensorflow:
In this code the dataset from kaggle was used.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) #The dataset is contain a number of cases that come to hospital and based on their situation they sent to different sections #So we used preprocessing method we get rid off unnecessary data #and then our data frame would be based on two parameters symptoms of the sick people person and sections #So we trained some with some neural algorithmusing using tensorflow , And find the accuracy in prediction</p>
